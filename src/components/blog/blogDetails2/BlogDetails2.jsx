                                    <h3>What is the Gig Economy?  </h3>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        You might probably wonder, what the gig economy is all about, well there is no particular definition of any sort. A gig economy is defined as an economy that encompasses all freelancers, part-time workers, independent contractors, and all who work for a shorter period of time when compared to a full-time employee. Most of us also have a common assumption that the gig economy is only for unskilled workers, that does not hold true. The gig economy includes all types of skilled, unskilled and semi-skilled workers who work on completing the task at hand and work on comparatively lesser duration in comparison to a full-time employee.


                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <h3>What is Gig Marketplace?</h3>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        We understood the meaning of gig economy, now it’s time for us to look at the bigger picture - The Gig Marketplace. What does the word ‘gig marketplace’ essentially mean? Let’s quickly break the word to get a better understanding. The word ‘Gig’ refers to anyone who is performing a job or a task given at hand. On the other hand, ‘marketplace’ simply refers to a labour market where business owners, employers and recruiters can look for the right specialists (in other words employees) and match them accordingly to the projects or the tasks that require the specific skills in the organisation.


                                    </p>
                                    <br />


                                    <p>
                                        With this fair understanding of the meaning of gig marketplace, let’s take a look into the different actors who are actively involved in the gig marketplace in India. In a crude form, there are only two actors in the gig marketplace which include the following:
                                    </p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><b>1) Gig Workers</b> - The individuals who work or offer their services fall under the purview of gig workers. In simple terms, gig workers refers to those individuals who extensively offer their services based on the assignments given to them. </li>
                                        <li><b>2) Gig Employers</b> - The gig employers includes all the employers or recruiters who employ or recruit gig workers whenever the need arises. They employ gig workers (which includes both skilled and unskilled workers) based on the type of work that must be completed. </li>
                                    </ol>



                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to the above mentioned actors of the gig marketplace India, there is a new addition to the list. In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of organisations that have turned out to bridge the gap between gig workers and gig employers. Since the gig economy is in its nascent stage, one can say that it is quite an unorganised sector as of now. There are no clear parameters or constructs in the gig economy of India which lets gig employers directly hire gig workers. Since the nature of the gig economy of India itself looks disformed, several organisations have come to aid both the gig workers and gig employers by acting as a bridge between the gig workers and gig employers, they are being called as gig economy aggregators. The main purpose of a gig economy aggregator is to help gig employers to reach out to the gig workers within the specified time frame and get the job done on time. On the other hand, a gig economy aggregator helps gig workers by matching them with the right task and by making use of their skills.

                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <h3>Who is the leading gig marketplace in India? Who is the top gig economy aggregator in India? </h3>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Of late, there has been an increase in the number of gig economy aggregators who offer extensive services across a broad spectrum of industries. In comparison, a gig marketplace and gig economy aggregator are terms that can be synonymously used. A gig economy aggregator will essentially refer to an institution that has its own gig marketplace, i.e they will have their own gig labour market that will help them to fulfill the demand for gig workers with the right supply of efficient gig workers. With the help of a gig economy aggregator, businesses can easily complete their tasks much faster, effectively and efficiently.

                                    <p>
                                        Coming to the last question, who’s the leading gig marketplace in India? Well, one can go on and list ‘n’ number of organisations. But we’re here to give you a guide on how to pick the right gig economy aggregator or leading gig marketplace in India. The following are a few factors you must keep in mind, before choosing to collaborate with a leading gig marketplace in India, they include.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>1) Stay grounded with the task that must be completed.</li>
                                        <li>2) Clearly enlist your requirements to the gig economy service provider. Make sure you are extremely vocal in this stage as it will help the service provider to streamline their services accordingly. </li>
                                        <li>3) The last yet the most important thing to do is to also point your key metrics of success and how you will calculate your profit/revenue from the same is a key component.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <br />
