                                    <h3>What is the meaning of the Gig Economy?  </h3>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Gig Economy essentially refers to a free market economy where employers hire employees, independent contractors, temporary workers for either short-term or long-term or until the need exists. However, what separates the gig economy from the rest is that the gig economy is aligned towards providing individuals with a temporary fix, where one gets to earn when compared to a full-time team member but doesn’t receive the organisational benefits.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <h3>What is the definition of the Gig Economy? </h3>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        You might now ask me, so what’s really the definition of the gig economy? The gig economy basically encompasses all types of gig workers, freelancers, independent contractors, temporary workers and so much more. A study conducted by the American Staffing Association shows that over 78% of the respondents see the gig economy as a new way to withstand an independent workforce.

                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        The main advantages of the gig economy are as follows;
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <h3>1) Flexibility </h3>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Whether you are a gig worker or an employer in the gig economy you have a wide range of flexibility. In case you are a gig worker, you can pick the gig of your choice, work comfortably around your personal schedule and receive your payments. You can switch between gigs and even take up multiple gigs and do it comfortably. On the other hand, if you are an employer, you can hire temporary gig workers for whenever they are in need. This flexible nature of the gig economy also allows employers to hire specialised gig workers, i.e. workers with specialised skills and talents for a brief period of time at lower costs.
                                    </p>

                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        The gig economy serves as a major source of income for several individuals. Whether you are a college student, someone looking for a part-time job or if you are looking to restart your career, gig economy is a great way for you to earn additional incomes. The millennials prefer the gig economy to a great extent because of the sole reason that it enables them to earn incomes to meet their daily requirements.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><b>1) Irregular Incomes</b> - One of the major disadvantages of the gig economy is that as a gig workers your incomes are often inconsistent since you are paid based on the longevity of the task or the project. You might have multiple tasks to complete over a week and almost only a couple of tasks for the rest of the month. This might pose as a disadvantage for many individuals who are used to getting a fixed pay at the end of the month.</li>
                                        <li><b>2) Lack of Benefits</b> - When compared to a full-time employee a gig worker often doesn’t have equal amount of benefits. However, there are several new rules and policies that have been laid down by the prescribed authorities in order to protect the gig workers and provide them with ample social security benefits. </li>
                                    </ol>
